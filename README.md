ulx-matmanager

This simple ULX addon will allow players to turn off trails (!notrails) or custom materials (!nomaterials) for their current map round.  This is useful for players who experience lag when a high number of trails are in use.

To clarify -- this doesn't actually turn trails off -- it prevents other people's trails from rendering on the player's local machine.  The materials option is secondary, and may not be as valuable to anyone.  I wrote it to allow local players to toggle the rendering of custom playermodel materials that are sold in Pointshop on THAB servers.
